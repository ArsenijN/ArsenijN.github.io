# RDSR - Radio Data System-enabled Radio

What's that?
This is a small project that I building because I switched to Poco from Samsung and I experience:
1. Lack of radio information
2. Quality of new phones build-in radio

So I maked this:
Portable, small Arduino-based radio that will be **better** than my phone!
(For those who asks "Who os that people who uses radio in 2025?": I love analog technology. It's have own charm, own point of interest)
