# RDSR - Radio Data System-enabled Radio

What's that?
This is a small project that I building because I switched to Poco from Samsung and I experience:
1. Lack of radio information
2. Quality of new phones build-in radio

So I maked this:
Portable, small Arduino-based radio that will be **better** than my phone!
(For those who asks "Who os that people who uses radio in 2025?": I love analog technology. It's have own charm, own point of interest)

For now I ordered bare minimum (only SD card slot and Si4703), so I can't test my GUI by [lopaka](https://lopaka.app)...
The list of details:

1. Si4703
2. Arduino Nano V3
3. Some source of power (AKA 18650 + TP4056 + MT3608)
4. Encoder with button
5. SSD1306 128x64 OLED screen
6. SD card slot (optional, depends of how many space was left after all libraries and code)
7. (Optionally) Bluetooth module JDY-62(A)
